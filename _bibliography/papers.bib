  title={NARX Modeling and Simulation of Heave Dynamics with Application of Robust Control of an Underactuated Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq and Tanveer, Ahsan},
  abstract={This article, which is an extension of the previous work of the authors (Tanveer and Ahmad (2022)) on yaw dynamics, investigates the modeling and control of heave degree-of-freedom of a compact custom designed ROV. Wherein, nonlinear data-driven modeling strategy is adopted to develop a high-fidelity heave dynamic model. The proposed modeling approach uses open-loop real-time experimental data to derive a high-fidelity NARX model of the vehicle. The resulting model accommodates the dynamics of the system in addition to the tether dynamics. The advantage of this approach is its ability to eliminate the need for intricate controller tuning. The identified model consistently demonstrated fitness scores ranging from 82% to 92% in both self-validation and cross-validation tests conducted on distinct datasets. This relative advantage is exemplified in real-time through the testing of a Genetic Algorithm Proportional-Integral (GAPI) controller. The performance of GAPI is subsequently compared with the relatively recent Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and the more conventional root-locus tuned PI controllers. The experimental results demonstrate that GAPI provides the most favorable response, achieving a 35%, 76%, and 44% improvement in rise time, percent overshoot and peak time, respectively. Furthermore, the controller effort required by GAPI running on an ATmega328 chipset is 22% less than its counterparts.

  abstract={Robotics is an integral part of Industry 4.0, playing a crucial role in creating autonomous workplaces. This study explores the integration of computer vision into the control system for a serial link robotic manipulator, emphasizing intelligent control strategies. YOLOv5 algorithm is utilized for target object detection, overcoming the challenge of estimating 3D positions from a single 2D camera image without any additional sensor, despite depth ambiguity. The research demonstrates successful object position estimation with mean errors of 5% along the X-axis and 1.2% along the Y-axis. A twofingered soft robotic gripper is fabricated, showing enhanced adaptability and safety in handling a variety of objects compared to a traditional aluminum gripper. The study contributes by applying monocular vision for object detection, integrating soft robotics for enhanced handling, and aligning with key Industry 4.0 principles.},

  title={Cross-coupled Dynamics and MPA-optimized Robust MIMO Control for a Compact Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  journal={Journal of Marine Science and Engineering},
  abstract={A compact, 3-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), low-cost, remotely operated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), or MicroROV, is custom-designed, developed, instrumented, and interfaced with a PC for real-time data acquisition and control. The nonlinear equations of motion (EoM) are developed for the under-actuated, open-frame, cross-coupled MicroROV utilizing the Newton-Euler approach. The cross-coupling between heave and yaw motion, an important dynamic of a class of compact ROVs that is barely reported, is investigated here. This work is thus motivated towards developing an understanding of the physics of the highly coupled compact ROV and towards developing model-based stabilizing controllers. The linearized EoM aids in developing high-fidelity experimental data-driven transfer function models. The coupled heave-yaw transfer function model is improved to an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model structure. The acquired models facilitate the use of the multi-parameter root-locus (MPRL) technique to design baseline controllers for a cross-coupled multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) MicroROV. The controller gains are further optimized by employing an innovative Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA). The robustness of the designed controllers is gauged using gain and phase margins. In addition, the real-time controllers were deployed on an onboard embedded system utilizing Simulink′s automatic C++ code generation capabilities. Finally, pool tests of the MicroROV demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.

  title={Mathematical Modelling and Fluidic Thrust Vectoring Control of a Delta Wing UAV},
  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  abstract={Pitch control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV) is a relatively novel technique requiring no moving control surfaces, such as elevators. In this paper, the authors’ previous work on the characterization of a static co-flow FTV rig is further validated using the free to pitch dynamic test bench. The deflection of a primary jet after injection of a high-velocity secondary jet was captured using the tuft flow visualization technique, along with the experimental recording of subsequent normal force impinged on the Coanda surface resulting in the pitching moment. The effect of primary and secondary flow velocities on exhaust jet deflection, as well as on the pitch angle of the aircraft, is examined. Aerodynamic gain as well as the inertia of a delta wing UAV test bench are computed through experiments and fed into the equation of motion (e.o.m). The e.o.m developed aided in the design of a model-based PID controller for pitch motion control using the multi-parameter root locus technique. The root locus tuned controller serves as a benchmark controller for performance evaluation of the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned controllers. Furthermore, the frequency domain metric of gain and phase margins were also employed to reach a robust control design. Experiments conducted in a simulation environment reveal that PSO-PID results in a better response of the UAV in comparison to the baseline pitch controller.

  author={Tanveer, Ahsan and Ahmad, Sarvat Mushtaq},
  abstract={In this paper, a custom built, underactuated, inspection class micro Remotely Operated Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (ROV) is employed as a testbed to investigate control and modelling problems related to underwater vehicles in shallow waters and pools. Dynamic model for yaw is obtained via mathematical modelling and system identification techniques. To instil confidence in the identified model, residuals and cross-validation tests are carried out to obtain high fidelity vehicle model for subsequent stabilizing closed-loop control design. Following the modelling exercise, design, real-time implementation, and analysis of a GA optimized PI controller for yaw is carried out. The performance of the GA optimized controller is benchmarked against the experimental results of a multi-parameter root-locus tuned PI controller and simulated responses of a standard linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In addition, the efficacy of the GA-PI controller is gauged employing recently developed marine predator algorithm (MPA). The need for a controller with optimized performance motivated the utilization of GA and MPA optimization techniques. The results from real-time pool experiments indicate substantially enhanced performance of GA optimized controller, outperforming other controllers by as much as 22% in performance indicators such as settling time and maximum overshoot. Furthermore, the GA optimized controller demonstrated far better robustness and disturbance rejection capabilities.

The vehicle is a custom-built inspection class micro-ROV. The model obtained is employed in the design of a proportional-integral (PI) depth controller. A novel multi-parameter root locus (MPRL) technique is proposed for controller tuning. The proposed method helps analyze the effect of varying multiple control parameters on the system’s response. Simulations and pool experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the followed model-based control design scheme for ROV’s station-keeping.
