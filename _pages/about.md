I am currently a doctoral student under Prof. <a href='https://amr.pku.edu.cn/jzyg/szdw/X/0dba539cb6214815a8b90e659d9eabef.htm'>Guangming Xie</a> at the School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University. Previously, I was a lecturer at the Institute of Avionics and Aeronautics (IAA), Air University, Islamabad. I obtained my master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKIEST), Swabi, in 2021. During my masters, I was affiliated with the Vibrational Dynamics and Controls (VDC) Lab, advised by Prof. Sarvat M. Ahmad. I received my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Engineering & Technology (UET), Peshawar, in 2019, advised by Prof. Mohammad A. Irfan. I have also worked at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan, and at the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Intelligent Manufacturing and Robotics (IRC-IMR), King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia.

Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in some of the modern areas of robotics, applied controls, and machine learning with special emphasis on marine robots.

More specifically, I’m interested in the following topics:

1. Underwater Soft Robot Modeling and Control

2. Bio-inspired Actuators for Untethered Underwater Robotics

2. Underwater Localization and Manipulation using Electrosensory Feedback

Please feel free to reach out, if you would like to talk about my work or discuss something of mutual interest.
